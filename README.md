# Health Calorie & BMI Tracker 💪🍎

This is my final project for Harvard's CS50x course.

## 📌 Project Description

This web app calculates your **daily calorie needs** and **Body Mass Index (BMI)** based on your age, weight, height, gender, and activity level. It provides:
- An estimate of required daily calories 🧮
- A BMI value and interpretation 🧠
- Helpful recommendations for improving your health 🌱
- It also saves user data in an Excel file for future reference.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Flask 🌶️
- HTML & CSS
- pandas & openpyxl (for saving user data to Excel)
- Pytest (for testing)

## 🧪 Features

- ✅ BMI calculation with interpretation
- ✅ Calorie estimation based on Mifflin-St Jeor Equation
- ✅ Activity level adjustment
- ✅ Supports both **metric** (cm, kg) and **imperial** (inch, lbs) units
- ✅ Responsive web interface
- ✅ Stores user input in an Excel file (`user_data.xlsx`)
- ✅ Unit testing with Pytest
